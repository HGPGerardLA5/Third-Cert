          <p>
            Piggy is a free-to-play survival horror story game released on January 28th, 2020 on ROBLOX by MiniToon. The objective of the game is to escape the map by finding and using keys, tools, and more, all while avoiding many evil anthropomorphic animals in an online, survival, episodic-horror game. It combines the game-play and aesthetics of the indie horror game Granny and the style of the popular children's show Peppa Pig (although the game has since strayed away from the TV show, as the game got popular and notable by many people). With different gamemodes, players can either be a survivor or Piggy,.The main goal in each map for survivors is to complete different tasks and escape or reach the goal while avoiding the Piggy before the timer runs out. Meanwhile, the Piggy has to kill all the survivors or at least prevent them from winning. Originally, the game was meant to be a joke, as a  game for MiniToon and his friends to play, but it has achieved multiple milestones.


Overall, Piggy has expanded a lot from just being a joke game on Roblox to having its own official website with its own action figures, and a lot more! 
          </p>

          <p>
            The beginning of Piggy takes place in the city of Lucella and starts with you trying to find someone called Georgie Piggy and later finding and taking revenge on Mr. P, who abandoned you in a Hospital. This all started with Mr. P, who caused the Infection accidentally thinking that it would help cure his wife, Mrs. P from her disease. While you try and find a cure, many events take a toll on your journey. Some of your choices might affect your adventure as well.

          <h3>House - Chapter 1</h3>
          <p>
  The Player is a police officer tasked to find a child named Georgie Piggy, who had been missing for unknown reasons. When the Player gets out of their car, they hear some strange sound. After they say that, someone sneaks up behind them and bashes them on the head. When the Player finally wakes up in the kids' bedroom, they realize they have been kidnapped and try to get out, but they find Penny Piggy waking up shortly after. Penny starts chasing them around, but the Player escapes and says that Penny looks familiar, though it is likely that they have never seen her before. The Player returns to the police station to report what they just experienced.
          </p>
<h3>Station - Chapter 2</h3>
          <p>
  After the Player escapes the house, they arrive at the station looking for help. When they get into the station, they ask if anyone is there, but then someone yells on the speaker saying there is a monster in the station, and Player is tasked with getting to the garage to escape the station. While trying to escape, the Player encounters the monster, who is Mother. Mother chases them, but the Player manages to open the barricaded door of the garage. Doggy tells them to bring some gas and fuel the car Doggy hid in. When the Player does so while evading Mother, Doggy and the Player escape the station, whereupon they tell each other that they are lucky that they showed up on their day off and bought gas, respectively.

After that, Doggy chats for a little bit with the Player about what is going on, and the Player responds with the amount of infected the Player has seen everywhere. Doggy then says that he and the Player need to find out what caused the infection and make sure that the Player didn't lose their past detective skills, to which the Player says they hope they haven't. While Doggy drives the car, Doggy abruptly asks the Player: “How much gas was in that can you gave?” and the screen cuts to black, starting the events of the next chapter.
          </p>
          <h3>Gallery - Chapter 3</h3>
          <p>
  After the events of Station, Doggy's car runs out of gas in the middle of the city, and they are surrounded by the monsters, specifically Mother, Father, and Sheepy (formerly with Teacher and Foxy). The Player and Doggy have no other choice but to run inside the nearby gallery, in which they seal themselves, only to realize that Father got inside as well. Because of this, the Player and Doggy have to escape. After they manage to escape, they have a little chat in the alleyway. The Player states that the monsters won't stop chasing them and Doggy tells them it's nothing they can handle, reminding them of the arrest they made in the alleys before the infection, and the Player says that they weren't arresting the infected, as they do nothing but attack them. Then, they have a conversation about not letting the world change who you are, after which the Player and Doggy decide to go to the forest for safety.
        </p>
        <h3>Forest - Chapter 4</h3>
          <p>
  The events of this chapter take place four weeks after the previous chapter. The Player talks to Doggy, saying that the monsters they encountered earlier resembled their friends. Doggy then tells the Player to rest for the night, as it is getting late. All of a sudden, a bark is heard and a sound of drinking (in Camp, it is revealed that Doggy was forced to drink a bottle of Substance - 128 by Pony). The Player wakes up when they hear this, only to realize that Doggy is absent. When the Player finds Doggy, he is infected. To make the situation worse, Sheepy has found the Player and is now out for them, however they manage to escape the forest. The Player finds a walkie-talkie on the ground, and the person on the other side asks if anyone is out there.
        </p>
        <h3>School - Chapter 5</h3>
          <p>
  After escaping the Forest, as Doggy becomes infected, the Player picks up a walkie-talkie found at the exit of the Forest. The voice over the walkie-talkie directs them to a school, and the voice mentions that his name is Mr. P, and he needs the Player to help his friend get out of the school safely. He also mentions meeting him in the school sewers after they save his friend. While trying to escape, the Player encounters Teacher, who chases them around the school. After inserting a book into the surveillance room, the Player finds Bunny. Mr. P's friend. She greets them joyfully and comes along with them. After meeting Mr. P in the sewers, the Player feels a little giddy and then faints. Later, the Player opens their eyes briefly to see themselves being rushed into the hospital on a stretcher, with Bunny at his side, assuring them that they are going to help them. The Player then briefly sees a hallucination of Doggy before they black out again.
          </p>
        <h3>Hospital - Chapter 6</h3>
          <p>
  After fainting in the epilogue of School - Chapter 5, the Player wakes up in the same hospital room. Bunny explains what happened while the Player was out, but doesn't tell them how long they were out for, avoiding the question altogether. While trying to escape, they encounter Beary. The Player and Bunny then go up to the roof where Mr. P is supposed to be waiting for them in a helicopter. However, when they got to the rooftop, Mr. P had already left without them. The Player and Bunny then decide to find another exit, but the Player notices how Bunny stays motionlessly and asks her if she is coming with them and she replies with: "Yeah. Coming". The cutscene then reveals that Bunny was looking at a note that says "I have to do this for our own good".
          </p>
          <h3>Metro - Chapter 7</h3>
          <p>
  After Mr. P leaves Bunny and the Player behind in Chapter 6, they go down to the metro station underneath the hospital. Before the chapter starts, Bunny states that she and the Player are almost out and that she just needs a little rest. While trying to fix the train, they encounter Zompiggy. Once the Player gets the train working, Bunny tells them that Mr. P gave her a bottle of Substance - 128 and she drank it, not knowing what it would do to her. The Player now learns that Bunny is fully becoming infected. They refuse to go without her but Bunny tells them that they have to leave without her. The Player then says goodbye to Bunny and she wishes them good luck. After that, the Player boards the train that leads to Carnival and leaves without her.
          </p>
          <h3>Carnival - Chapter 8</h3>
          <p>
  After the events of the metro escape, the Player is determined to find Mr. P for giving out potions and infecting everyone, including Bunny, and stop him from doing so any further. Thinking Mr. P is in his carnival, the Player travels all the way from the metro to his carnival and goes inside. After escaping Clowny, the Player finds two new survivors, Zizzy and Pony, instead of meeting Mr. P. Pony at first assumes the Player is infected, but Zizzy reminds him that the infected can't talk. Zizzy then introduces herself and Pony to the Player explains that both of them were looking for survivors of the infection, and tells the Player that they've got a safe place. Suddenly, Foxy (an infected who escaped from the cage which the Player had to open to obtain the white key) appears behind the Player, about to attack them. Pony thinks that Foxy is the Player's friend, but Zizzy tells him that he's no friend and that he is infected. Upon hearing that, Pony rushed in time to knock Foxy out with his wooden sword. Zizzy then tells the Player that the place where they currently are is not safe at all and that she and Pony will bring them to their safe place.
          </p>
          <h3>City - Chapter 9</h3>
          <p>
  After the events of Chapter 8, Zizzy, Pony, and the Player are standing on a rooftop of one of the buildings in a city and are looking at the safe place from above. However, the gate to the safe place is blocked and on fire, and they have to venture through the abandoned city to unlock the gate. While doing so, they encounter an infected duo, Elly and Grandmother. After finally escaping, the three have a chat. The Player tells them that they were a police officer looking for Georgie Piggy, and Pony tells them that he was trying to be an optometrist like his father, and Zizzy explains that she was a fencing coach and that she taught her little sisters too. The Player then mentions that Mr. P has been giving out potions that turn you into the infected and that they are trying to stop him. Zizzy suggests that they can help, and that the Player can stay with them. They are then interrupted by a noise coming from a nearby dumpster, and the Player and Zizzy decide to go to find out who was watching them. Pony wishes them good luck and stays behind.
          </p>
          <h3>Mall - Chapter 10</h3>
          <p>
  Immediately after the events of City, the Player and Zizzy follow a shadowy figure to a nearby mall. There, they find that the figure has barricaded themselves in a storage room. They encounter an enhanced security droid with a chainsaw arm which tries to hunt them down, and also have to avoid an infected mouse lurking in one of the vents. After unlocking the barricaded doors, Zizzy orders the stalker to show themselves, and they turn out to actually be Georgie Piggy. The Player asks Georgie what happened, and he tells them that after his family came back from the hospital, they started acting strangely, so he escaped from his home and went to the city to find his Grandmother. However, she and the rest of the residents of the city started behaving just as strangely as his family, so he hid inside the mall. The Player and Zizzy then tell Georgie that he should come with them to the safe place. Georgie asks the Player if he will see his family ever again, and the Player promises him that they find the person who started the infection. After that, the three go to the safe place, where they meet Zee, Zuzy, Pony, Giraffy and Mimi. Pony then says that he has tracked Mr. P's helicopter signal, so the Player decides to follow it. Before they do it, however, Zizzy tells her sisters to take care of Georgie while she is absent. Pony, Zizzy and the Player decide to be the ones to go stop Mr. P once and for all.
          </p>
          <h3>Outpost - Chapter 11</h3>
          <p>
  The Player, Zizzy, and Pony track Mr. P's helicopter signal to a military outpost, which is infested with infected soldiers and a mysterious character named Torcher. At the end, the trio gets ready to go into the military plant, but they find out Georgie followed them, since he wants to see the person responsible for the infection of his family. However, Pony tells him that he attracted a lot of the infected soldiers. Pony and Zizzy stay behind to fight the crowd while the Player and Georgie go to the plant to confront Mr. P. They eventually find him, but they discover that he is a cyborg now and that he replaced one of his arms with a gun. The Player tells him that they have come to stop his evil plans, but Mr. P replies that the Player and Georgie aren't real, thinking his mind is playing tricks on him. The Player is confused about this statement, but then Mr. P says that they are dead and tells them to leave him alone. He then runs away, so the Player and Georgie run after him.
          </p>
          <h3>Plant- Chapter 12</h3>
          <p>
  The Player and Georgie chase after Mr. P, who stops running abruptly. He says that he only wanted to be left alone, but that the memories still haunt him. He then tells the Player that they are just as stubborn as him when he tried to save his wife, but that now, he will stop them like he should have stopped himself. He then cocks his gun as the round starts. By finishing and surviving both phases of the round, another cutscene plays where Mr. P stops his attack thinks about his actions. Georgie wants to hurt Mr. P, since he is a direct culprit for the infection of his family, but the Player prevents him from doing so, telling him that he won't be any better than Mr. P if he does so. Mr. P then makes a decision to continue fighting off the infected, and this is where you can choose to go with either Mr. P or Georgie. To determine which ending you get, you must decide either to go with Georgie or to stay with Mr. P.

      There are 3 endings obtainable in this chapter:
      <ul>
        <li>Good Ending</li>
        <li>Bad Ending</li>
        <li>True Ending</li>
        </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Good Ending</b>: When both the Player and Georgie Piggy leave Mr. P in the plant, they find both Zizzy and Pony alive, who just have finished off every Soldier there. They notice the Player and Georgie and congratulate them on their success. However, Pony then asks what they should do next. Georgie insists that they search for a cure, ending the cutscene and making the screen black for a second. After the credits, Mr. P's hat is shown, implying that he died.
          </p>
      <p>
        <b>Bad Ending</b>: In this ending, the Player instead stays there and begs Mr. P to go with them, but Badgy appears behind the Player and attacks them. In the next scene, the Player is standing over Mr. P's hat.
          </p>
           <p>
        <b>True Ending</b>: In this ending, Mr. P explains to the Player how the infection started. His wife, Mrs. P, was sick with a virus called Linnaeoma, so he funded a research for the cure and even rushed the doctors to test it. Despite their warnings that the cure, code-named Substance - 128, is not fully safe yet, Mr. P already started searching for the test subjects. The Piggy Family, except for Georgie, volunteered to test the cure. At first, the test seemed successful, so Mr. P gave a potion to Mrs. P too.
            </p>
            <p>
Everything was fine until Mr. P heard the news that the Piggy Family started becoming hostile. He initially thought it had nothing to do with his cure, but then his wife started becoming hostile too, and her eyes turned red. Mr. P knew he had to stop her, but he didn't have a heart to do it, so he let her go instead. Then, he funded more research for this new virus at the Hospital, trying to make things right again.
            </p>
            <p>
Then, the Player came along. When they fell unconscious, they discovered that the Player had the symptoms of infection, but they didn't get infected. As Mr. P did more research, the Hospital was raided and Bunny was attacked. Mr. P tried to save her with a different potion, but realized what he had done and fled the Hospital in regret, also giving up on the Player for being infected.
            </p>
            <p>
After Mr. P is done talking, the Player and Georgie walk out of the Plant, and the rest of the ending plays out the same as the Good Ending. In the credits, every infected that appears in Good and Bad Ending are gone, and so is Mr. P's hat. This implies that something happened to the infected and Mr. P, but no one knows what.

        <h3>Alleys - Chapter 1</h3>
          <p>
  The Player has a flashback of an arrest that they made before the infection. In this flashback, the Player and Doggy are tasked to arrest Willow and Rash, two thieves who have been stealing food and other supplies from all around the city. During gameplay, the two police officers try to find Willow among the alleyways while avoiding getting caught by Rash. Once the two finally manage to corner Willow, she begs them not to arrest her, since she needed the food to feed her family, but turns herself in without resisting. Rash attempts to take the Player and Doggy by surprise, but Willow dissuades him from doing so, saying that it isn’t worth it. Rash reluctantly agrees but warns the Player and Doggy that they haven’t seen the last of them, and the screen fades to black.
              </p>
              <p>
The next part shows the Player and Doggy walking out of the room, but the Player stops and tells Doggy that this doesn’t feel right. They then have a conversation about how this is just the way things have to be and that they couldn't do anything about it. As they exit, a white flash ends the flashback and returns you to the events following the end of Book 1.
                </p>
                <p>
Zee, Zuzy, and Georgie are playing tag outside the Safe Place, while Giraffy can be seen gardening some plants in the background. Pony asks the Player if they are coming, and they ask where, confused. Mimi then approaches the Player and asks them if they remember the radio they found in one of their supply runs. When the Player asks her if she can get it working, she tells them that she can, but she needs some batteries for it. Zizzy and Pony then ask the Player if they would want to go to the store to get the batteries, which the Player accepts. The Player, Pony and Zizzy then head out of the Safe Place.
          </p>
          <h3>Store - Chapter 2</h3>
          <p>
  It starts with the Player, Zizzy, and Pony in a store searching for batteries. While being there, they encounter Dessa. After the trio make it out, they go back to the safe place with the batteries. When they come back, Mimi and Giraffy are standing next to the radio. While both are happy to see you back, Giraffy is displeased by the fact that he lost a bet he had with Mimi, and that he will have to cook for the rest of the week. Mimi uses the batteries to restore the radio mentioned in the previous chapter. It eventually works and someone starts to talk, claiming to be called Settlement Six. They say that are looking for any communities to trade with and request to meet up. They tell the safe place members to meet them at Old Oak, but then they lose the signal.
            </p>
            <p>
Mimi is delighted, wanting to meet them, but Pony is reluctant. Giraffy starts to doubt Pony, asking if he's joking. Pony replies that he is being serious about this and won't go. Zizzy agrees with Pony but still wants to meet up. Pony is surprised and tries to convince Zizzy out of it. Zizzy reassures Pony by saying: "Pony, we know how to handle ourselves out there. If we get into trouble, we know how to get out of it". The Player agrees with Zizzy, remembering when Zizzy and Pony fought the whole army of infected soldiers in the Outpost. Pony hesitates, but then gives in, still not trusting the Settlement. Zizzy asks who is staying. Giraffy says that he will need to stay, so that he can harvest as much food as he can before the winter comes. Mimi stays also, so she can continue to fix the radio. It ends up with you, Zizzy, and Pony again to meet the mysterious group.
              </p>
              <p>
When the screen lights up, the trio is in the forest. Pony asks if it's the right place since no one is around. Willow then appears along with Tigry, Pandy, Kitty, and Baren, surrounding you. Willow walks up to Pony, revealing that he was an ex-member, saying "It's a shame that you left us". From what Willow reveals is that Pony was a good friend friend of hers, but adds that he is nothing to her now. Willow then turns to the Player, accusing them of taking her family away from her. Willow says that the Player must have felt good for themselves, ripping her away from the ones she cared about. She then walks over to Zizzy, questioning about who she is, saying that she had certainly never seen her before. Zizzy snaps back, stating that she knows everything about Willow and her "sick" crew. Willow states that Pony must of told a lot of about them. Willow adds that it was one of Pony's many flaws, saying that he could never keep his mouth shut.
              </p>
              <p>
Willow then wonders what to do, then comes up with an idea. She orders her gang to take Zizzy and leave the rest "to rot". Pony starts to run to Zizzy, shouting to Willow to leave her alone, but Willow whips out her revolver, telling him that she doesn't want to hurt anyone. She tells Pony that they're only taking Zizzy for questioning. Zizzy promises to Pony that she will stay safe and will come back. Willow points out that Zizzy understands and starts to flee.
                </p>
                <p>
Pony is frozen to the spot as they take Zizzy with them. Pony reveals to the Player that they are called The Silver Paw, also known as T.S.P. Pony admits that when the infection broke out, he needed to find a group, so he joined them. Pony says that they did awful things but he was too scared to leave. The Player asks Pony what made him leave them, which Pony refuses to tell, saying that it is a story for another time and changes the subject, stating that they need to save Zizzy before it's too late. The Player suggests Pony to tell the others what happened, but Pony says that there is no time and that he needs the Player now. The Player then joins Pony and the two follow them(the T.S.P).
          </p>
          <h3>Refinery - Chapter 3</h3>
          <p>
  The Player and Pony, looking for Zizzy, arrive at the The Silver Paw base, which is an oil refinery. Pony states that he doesn't recognize this building, but they should be able to find Zizzy and escape anyway. The game then starts. Tigry, a member of The Silver Paw, is chasing the Player while they try to navigate the refinery, and the other members of The Silver Paw can attack them as well if they spot them. The Player and Pony break into a room and find Zizzy knocking out an Infected called Poley. She says she has been battling infected all day and that she even started enjoying doing it. Then, the Player tells Zizzy that they should get out of there soon because the The Silver Paw will find out that something went wrong sooner or later. But then, Zizzy reveals her arm and sees that she has a scratch from an infected, and she realizes that she will become infected.
            </p>
            <p>
She tells the Player and Pony to go, but Pony tells her that they will find a cure for her. Zizzy says that if there was a cure, then they wouldn't be here in the first place. She then says that she will sabotage as much as she can to make a distraction and tells the Player and Pony to leave once more. Pony reluctantly agrees, hugs her and says goodbye. The Player tells Zizzy to take care. Zizzy says goodbye too and then says that she will miss both of you. The Player and Pony leave the base, with Zizzy presumably turning into an infected. The scene then switches to the Player and Pony returning to the The Safe Place. Mimi, Giraffy, Georgie, Zee, Zuzy, who were all waiting, stare silently at the Player and Pony in dismay, knowing what happened.
          </p>
          <h3>The Safe Place - Chapter 4</h3>
          <p>
  After the events of the Refinery, the Player is sleeping in their bed in The Safe Place. Suddenly, they are woken up by an explosion. Georgie tells them that they need to get out. Although they're chased by Raze, the Player manages to escape the Safe Place, rescuing Mimi, Pony, and Giraffy in the process, while Zee and Zuzy had already escaped through the vents. After the Player and the rest of the Safe Place residents escape, they find themselves confronted by Willow and the rest of The Silver Paw (excluding Tigry). Willow tells them that after the Player and Pony broke into the Refinery, all of the members there had to be relocated. After the confrontation, Willow orders Filip and Kitty to capture all the residents, despite the fact that Georgie, Mimi and Giraffy did nothing. 
            </p>
            <p>
  The Silver Paw brings the residents to the factory and locks them in one of its jail cells. Giraffy and Mimi apologize to Pony for not listening to him telling him to not trust the radio, and Pony forgives them, afterwards saying that they need to find a way to get out.
          </p>
          <h3>Sewers - Chapter 5</h3>
          <p>
  After Willow captures the group and puts them into jail, Zee, and Zuzy pop out of the sewer lid in the cell and asks someone to help get another sewer cell open. The Player agrees to go and help the zebra sisters. Beforehand, they tell the others to stay since if more of them go, the guards would get suspicious. After avoiding Alfis and opening the sewer cell, the sisters say that they have to go back to the The Safe Place to get some things. The Player thanks them and asks them to meet the others outside of the place. The Player then opens the cell, and the group starts making their escape. Tigry notices this and is about to throw his dagger towards the group, but decides not to do it owing to the fact that The Silver Paw was cruel to him. Willow then pushes Tigry aside, calling him a "useless tiger," and then aims her revolver. She was about to shoot Pony, but inadvertently shoots Giraffy, who reacted fast to the gunshot and dived into the way. The Player asks the others to help Giraffy get out of the place safely, while Pony and The Player have a standoff with Willow. Willow agrees to settle the score between them with the quote, "With pleasure. Let's dance, darling." This then leads to the next chapter, Factory.
            </p>
            <h3>Factory - Chapter 5</h3>
          <p>
  The Player and Pony stay to stop Willow while Mimi, Giraffy, Georgie, and Tigry head off to find safety. Willow hears something coming up from the sewers, mentions that it does not sound friendly, and then says how a battle would be unfair, since she has a gun, so she decides to give the Player and Pony a head start. The ending cutscene will change depending on the Player's actions during gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
          There are 3 endings obtainable in this chapter, but only 2 will apply to the storylines:

        <li>Worst Ending</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
  <b>Savior Ending</b>: After the Player and Pony escape the factory, they come outside with the T.S.P. members that they saved. Willow also appears, clutching her shoulder. She raises her gun at the Player and prepares to shoot. Katie begs Willow not to and tells her that Player saved their lives, but Willow retorts that they destroyed hers. However, right before Willow fires at the Player, Zee and Zuzy appear and yell at the Player to look out. Seeing Zee and Zuzy confuses Willow, who asks who they are, to which Pony replies that they are Zizzy's sisters, which she is distraught at the news at. Tigry then throws a dagger at Willow, knocking her gun out of her hand. Willow says that she had no idea Zizzy had sisters, and that she is sorry. Mimi tells the group that Giraffy is going to be okay, but he needs to rest for a while. Katie and the rest of T.S.P. decide to help take care of Giraffy, as they have the equipment to help him. Although Pony is skeptical, Giraffy convinces the group that he will be fine. Willow then mentions that she can save Zizzy. She reveals that the military moved up north to work on a cure for the virus, which she heard from radio broadcasts. Katie questions why they weren't told, and Willow says that she vowed to use the cure for William if he was ever found. She knows that William is gone, and she wants to use the cure on Zizzy so the sisters won't have to feel what she felt. The Player questions Willow on if it's a trap or not, and Willow says that she'll go with them as they would have her weapon to defend themselves. Georgie finally says that he trusts Willow. He says that although they all lost something, grouping together means they can get what they lost back. The group puts aside their differences to finally save Zizzy.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>Survivor Ending</b>: This ending is almost the same as the Savior Ending, except for the fact that not all of the T.S.P. members will be present, and instead of the T.S.P. members volunteering to take care of Giraffy, Mimi will instead.

            <h3>Port - Chapter 7</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Savior Ending</b>:
  Willow, Pony, The Player, Zee, Zuzy, Mimi and Georgie Piggy arrive at a port near the ocean. Willow explains that while she would love to take them across the North Sea, Tigry stole her tugboat. Then, Mimi wonders if they could get the lighthouse working again. After the Player turns the lighthouse's beacon on while getting ambushed by an infected called Dakoda, a huge ship called "The Medora" arrives. The Safe Place members get on the ship, and they ask who is there. Suddenly, Budgey appears and explains how she is the captain of the ship and asks if they are the ones that lit the lighthouse. The group explains how they need help to cross the North Sea. While Budgey has spare fuel, she explains that it is sealed in the lower levels of the ship, and how the rest of her crew is also there, but they are trapped, since they were infected by the sickness and curse Davy Jones brought upon them. Willow and the Player eventually decide to go down there together after a short discussion. Mimi then asks the captain where they would be heading to if they managed to get the fuel successfully. Budgey then replies, saying that they would be heading to Doveport. Mimi exclaims that she knows an engineer friend from there, but was not sure whether he was still there. Budgey then tells them to not feed the fish down there, possibly an idiom for dying/getting infected.

            <h3>Ship - Chapter 8</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Savior Ending</b>:
  Budgey first says that they need to find gasoline. Thus, both the Player and Willow decide to head down beneath the Medora to retrieve the fuel. The Player is then ambushed by an infected crew member named Archie, along with Pepper, Bobby, and Kenneth. After opening the green crate where the fuel is, the Player and Willow conversate about the amount of fuel left when suddenly, Kenneth comes from behind as the Player warns Willow, whereupon the opening of the crate closes. Willow angrily bangs on the door, then complains about being stuck with the Player in the fuel crate. The Player argues with her and conversate about their separate lives, and eventually she asks where her parents are. The Player says that they don't have their records on Willow's parents, and after more arguments, the rest of the Safe Place group eventually finds them locked up. Pony says that Georgie was the one who managed to find them after hearing them fighting down below deck. Zuzy jokes about him being helpful for once in finding you. Mimi also says that they can't waste time, as they have got a friend to meet, and that they have got a mission to follow. There is then a loud gunshot/boom noise coming from above. Pony suggests that everyone checks it out. Budgey, saying they surprisingly made it, eventually has the screen turn to a sky view, in which there are (somewhat) loud gunshots and sparks in the sky as the screen fades into black.

            <h3>Docks - Chapter 9</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Savior Ending</b>:
  The Player and their allies get off of Budgey's ship and down onto the docks. Budgey wishes the team good luck before they part their ways. Willow sees Tigry off in the distance. It is at this point in which the map begins. After finishing the map, the Player walks into a large hallway consisting of 2 bridges held above a large pit. They then see Tigry walking across the other platform, and the Player and Tigry greet each other. Tigry explains how he never actually wanted to harm the Player, and was doing what he was told instead of what he preferred, and the Player proceeds to quote Doggy with the line "sometimes we do things because we have to, not because we want to." Tigry attempts to convince the Player into abandoning Willow, but the Player decides not to trust Tigry, and Tigry leaves, still keeping his offer in chance the Player changed their mind. Pony then arrives, asking what he missed. The Player fills him in, and Pony expresses how he trusts Tigry, but the Player attempts to change that. The entire group is then shown exiting and walking across a large, snowy field with many loud explosions along the ground. The Player is then jumped by a blue-eyed Robby with no chainsaw and falls, but is not attacked. Kona then peers out of a large house in the background and remarks towards the Player before the group goes inside. Kona says hello to the group and meets with Mimi again and they have a friendly moment. Kona then describes how he once studied robotics, but now prefers to study the infected. He encourages them to go through the exit under his home, joking that it's even more dangerous than outside and then says that he's pulling their leg, or so he hopes. He allows the blue-eyed Robby to travel with the group, and gives Mimi a portable radio to use so that they can stay in contact with each other.

Kona greets the group, while the Player, who is still bewildered by the Robby lookalike asks who he is, and Kona explains that he's a helper robot. Kona guesses that the group is there for the cure, then explains that the military evacuated everyone further north. He allows them to exit through his lab and jokes that it's probably even more dangerous than outside, and then says that he's pulling their leg, or so he hopes. He tells Robby to keep the group safe while they venture downstairs.

            <h3>Temple - Chapter 10</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Savior Ending</b>:
  After meeting with Kona, the Player and Robby head under Kona's lab to escape, and let the others in. Upon entering, the two meet an infected spider named, Spidella, who chases them around. Once they escape, the Player starts feeling "off", and goes through a vision.
          </p>
          <p>
Inside the vision, the Player sees Bunny, Doggy, and Zizzy who tell the Player that they're awake. The Player is frightened, and repeats that they aren't real. Suddenly, the Player encounters a mysterious figure that tells them that he's been fascinated by them, and that they should be infected because they got hit at the house, but they aren't. The Player asks the mysterious figure why he wants them, and TIO tells them that he can help them see their friends again. The Player denies, saying that they don't trust TIO. TIO reveals that the Player is immune to the infection, and his last words to the Player are that they shouldn't get in his way, and to stay out of his business. Player shouts at him telling him to leave them alone, and then the Player wakes up nearly punching Pony. Pony asks the Player if he saw TIO, and the Player replies saying they had, and asking who he is. Pony says that he doesn't know, and that he said that he could help see his parents again. Willow, hearing Pony mention his parents, tells him to tell the Player what happened to them. Pony refuses to tell the Player what happened, and an argument starts between Pony and Willow.
          </p>
          <p>
Mimi stops the argument, by telling them to stay focused, and that they are nearly there on finding the cure. Robby stays behind to watch the children, but the children want to stay with the group. The group and Robby allow it, and they head towards a military camp, which Kona says over the Mimi’s walkie talkie that there's something strange about it.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Survivor Ending</b>: 
  The Player, Willow, and Pony get to the snowy surface. Robby says he would stay behind and take care of the children, and leaves. The group then talks about how it’s odd that the infected have been pulled to where the supposed cure is, that someone is “pulling the strings”. After the short conversation, the group then takes off near the military camp.
            </p>
            <h3>Camp - Chapter 11</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Savior Ending</b>:
  Kona continues to talk to Mimi through the walkie-talkie, telling her that the outpost ahead has in fact been quiet for a while. After that, Willow asks the Player what damage has caused, the Player responds with that there is barely any damage, and that the soldiers got infected by surprise, after the Player unlocks the elevator to the bunker, they have a chat with Pony, and Pony reveals that he tried to infect them (which explains why he assumed them as the infected) and later revealed that he infected Doggy with Substance 128 in the Forest because The Silver Paw forced him to do it. The Player doesn't like it at all but Georgie reminds that the Player told him back at the Plant him to forgive people that hurt you because they are no better when hurting back, and the Player didn't forgive but still agreed to still be friends with Pony. Meanwhile, Willow looks at something and looks sad. When she is asked about it, she replies that it's nothing. 
    </p>
    <p>
    They later go down to the bunker and split up to find the cure. Willow then meets Tigry, while he is placing dynamites in attempt to stall them. These two start an argument. Tigry argues about what Willow did before and claims that she's nothing but a bully. Willow gets offended, since she fed him and shelters him, but all she gets is this. Eventually, this argument turns to a fight, while the Player tries to calm them down, but to no use. After a few seconds of brutal fighting, Willow grabs Tigry in a stranglehold in attempt to knock him out, but then, an explosion occurs (probably by the dynamites placed by Tigry), causing the rubble to fall down, trapping the Player in a small area. The Player says that now they have to find a way out on their own. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, at the other side of the door, the shadowy figure of distorted Penny Piggy appears, staring at the Player through the window.
          </p>
  <p>
            <b>Survivor Ending</b>: 
  Without Mimi, the group heads to the Camp without warning. In the ending, Pony doesn't reveal he gave the potion to you and Doggy. Willow and the Player later find Tigry about to set an explosive dynamite. Willow and Tigry have a chat about the past, with Tigry explaining all the bad things Willow has done to him, and they then turn the argument into a fight, which ends with Willow grabbing Tigry in a stranglehold to knock him out, but stops when the rubble caused by an explosion falls, trapping the Player, and at the end, a distorted Penny Piggy appears behind a door.
            </p>
            <h3>Lab - Chapter 12</h3>
          <p>
  Note there are 4 endings of this chapter(and henceforth the entire piggy series): 2 focus on siding with <b>Willow</b>, while the other 2 focus on siding with <b>Tigry</b>.

  <p>
    <b>Willow's side:-</b>
    <p>
            <b>Savior Ending</b>:
  The Player makes their way through the military lab, and then grabs the cure. Willow thanks the Player for saving her, although she did not need it. The Player makes sure that she really didn't need help, since she looked like she was in trouble a while ago. Both start to get into a small argument, but eventually they set it out. The Player then reminds Willow to grab the cure before leaving. After exiting the lab and the camp, the Player finds Pony, sitting against a tree. The player asks if Pony was okay, but Pony says that things used to be okay only before this infection, and that nothing's been okay since it started. Pony reveals that he is going to turn into the infected, since he was attacked at the Docks. The Player still does not believe Pony and asks him to get up, as they have to save Zizzy. However, Pony says that he can't even feel his legs anymore, and it's time the Player should cure Zizzy himself. From behind, Willow comes. Looking at the cure and Pony once more, she walks away. The Player suddenly remembers the cure is with Willow, but alas, couldn't find her. Pony already knows she is not coming, and went away for her own selfish reasons. The Player then falls, asking Pony if he was joking, and that this joke, was a terrible and twisted one. However, Pony says that he can lie all day, and the truth would only hurt more. Pony then asks the Player to do him one last favor; to take care of Georgie, Zee and Zuzy. Another favor Pony asks the Player to do is to cheer up, since they have come this far. Pony admits that without the Player, he couldn't have gone this far. Suddenly, the Player forgives Pony for infecting Doggy. Pony is surprised, but the Player says that he really does forgive Pony, since he had to live with the regret of infecting Doggy this whole time, and it would have been horrible. Pony then asks the Player if he would remember him after, but his speech is interrupted by Willow. She gives the cure to Pony. Pony asks Willow if this is some sort of sick trick she's doing, but Willow does say that it would be a trick if Pony doesn't take the cure. Pony thanks Willow, but asks her why she didn't want to cure the ones she wanted to. Although Willow hates to admits it, she says that Pony is necessary. Pony says that that was the nicest thing Willow ever said to him. Willow agrees, and says that it will be that way. Suddenly, Mimi and, Georgie, Giraffy, Zee and Zuzy arrive. Giraffy exclaims that he is happy to see everyone again, and he reveals that via his radio, he contacted Mimi, since he felt much better, and went across the ocean with the help of The Silver Paw. Mimi apologizes for leaving Willow, Pony and the Player since they had to get Giraffy. Georgie asks if the Player found the cure. Not wanting to admit the truth, Willow says that the cure was crushed under the rubble. Zuzy sadly asks if they can't save Zizzy in that case. Pony goes to Zuzy and says that it would be hard moving forward, but Zizzy would've wanted Zuzy to stay strong. Zuzy agrees that she would miss Zizzy, but Zizzy taught her to be tough and strong. Giraffy then says that maybe sometime, another cure would be made, and Mimi agrees to him, since the scientists were able to make one now. The Player then remembers that since Kona was studying the infected, he could help the group make their own cure. He also suggests grabbing any files from the military lab. Mimi says that that if for a brighter future, when suddenly, Georgie realizes and asks where is Willow.

Pony also will miss the Player, but at the bright side, he says that he doesn't need to miss Zizzy anymore, and considers himself lucky. The Player agrees, and hopes to see Pony some time again. The Player then walks away.

            <b>Tigry's side:-</b>
    <p>
            <b>Savior Ending</b>:
  The Player makes their way through the military lab, and then grabs the cure. Tigry thanks the Player for helping him to defeat Willow. Tigry also says that the Player can get the cure instead of him. The Player is first reluctant, but later agrees. On their way back to the elevator, they meet Pony. Suddenly, Tigry realizes that his charges are going off, and that they should head to the elevator immediately. However, Tigry gets stuck by a barrier himself, and the elevator is also barricaded. Pony then reveals that he was attacked at the Docks, and therefore is going to turn into an infected as well. Due to this, the Player forgives Pony. Suddenly, TIO appears in front of the Player. With no choice, the Player joins TIO, in order to save their friends.

Tigry also says that the Player can get the cure instead of him. The Player is first reluctant, but later agrees. The Player then goes out of the lab, to the entrance of the camp, but then gets ambushed by Mary from behind, who scratches their leg. Pony, who is sitting against the trees, shoots Mary and jokes about how both of them are going to turn into the infected. However, as the Player has the cure, Pony suggests that the Player should use it on themselves. The Player then calls Pony crazy, and says that they are going to cure Pony. Pony then reveals that he infected Doggy at the forest, as he was instructed to do so by The Silver Paw. Not knowing what to say, the Player thought that Pony was good, and that he trusted him his whole life. Pony reminds the Player that he has the cure, so he can cure themselves. Pony himself says that this is the day he would be getting his payback for all he did in the past, and that he accepted this day would finally arrive. The Player apologizes to Pony and walks away.
